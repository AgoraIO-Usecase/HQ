# Agora Account and App ID


### Create an Account and Obtain an App ID

In order to build and run the sample application you must obtain an App ID: 

1. Create a developer account at [agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/). Once you finish the signup process, you will be redirected to the Dashboard.

2. Navigate in the Dashboard tree on the left to **Projects** > **Project List**.

3. Copy the App ID that you obtained from the Dashboard into a text file. You will use this when you build and run your application.
