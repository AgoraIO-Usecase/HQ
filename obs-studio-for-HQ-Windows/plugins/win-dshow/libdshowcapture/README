libdshowcapture

   This library was created as a means to simplify the process of using
   DirectShow to capture video and/or audio devices, such as webcams, capture
   devices (internal, USB 2.0, USB 3.0), microphones, auxiliary sound inputs,
   etc.

   The biggest goal of this project is to eventually support as many devices as
   possible, as well as add more interesting features later on for improving
   performance.
