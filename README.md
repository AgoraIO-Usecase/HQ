### Agora HQ Trivia Game Flow

Players can participate in daily trivia games and win prize money. The game consists of a round of 10-12 questions. Each question has three answer choices.

- The host asks a the series of questions, each with increased difficulty.

- Players who correctly answer the question within the 10-second limit continue through the game. Players who answer incorrectly are eliminated from the game.

- At the end of the game, players that answer all the questions questions correctly, split the prize money.

### Agora SDK Integrations

SDK|Description
---|---
Agora Interactive Broadcast SDK|The host/broadcaster pushes voice and video streams to the participants/audience/clients in real time
Agora Signaling  SDK|The host broadcasts questions for the audience members to answer using messaging. This SDK:<ul><li> Manages communication between the audience members and the host</li><li>Retrieves the number of current users in the channel</li><li>Pushes questions and answers back and forth</li><li>Acts as the synchronization mechanism (SEI)</li></ul>
Special SDK|Native media  + signaling (chat) + SEI (V2_0_2)


### Agora Game Demo

Agora provides a set of demo applications available for download. The demo applications use a preconfigured the test server and App ID, and can support up to 30,000 simultaneous audience members.

The Agora HQ Trivia demo consists of the following parts:

## Architecture Overview

The Agora Game Show template provides a base architecture for a live quiz application network. The game members consist of at least one host and multiple audience members. The host quizzes the audience, and the audience member that answers all the questions correctly receives a prize.

- [Template Branches](#template-branches)
- [API Services](#api-services)
- [Communication Breakdown](#communication-breakdown)
- [Sample App Resources](#sample-app-resources)


### Template Application Types

The template consists of two main application types:

Application Type|Platform|Preview
---|---|---
Host application|Windows only|![hq_demo.png](images/hq_demo.png)
Audience member application|iOS and Android|![hq_answer.png](images/hq_answer.png)

The host controls the game configuration and settings for all audience members that join the game.

Host Features|Audience Member Features
---|---
<ul><li>Update the language pack for the application</li><li>Fix crashes when the number of choices is less than four</li><li>Add operational navigation</li><li>Update configuration settings for the game</li><li>Restart the game</li></ul>|<ul><li>Start a game</li><li>Join / leave a channel</li><li>Receive a question</li><li>Answer a question</li><li>Show game results</li></ul>

**Note:** All game members (host and audience) must join with the same Agora App ID and channel name, or they will not be entered into the same game.

### Template Branches

There are three main game show templates available. Each template has its own separate branch in the Github repository. Learn more about the choosing the a [template branch for your project](#download-the-hq-sdk-and-choose-a-template-branch).

Template Model|Communication Flow|Description
---|---|---
Basic Live Broadcast Model|![contest_live_simple.png](images/contest_live_simple.png)|Allows the host to broadcast a live quiz for audience members to answer questions using messaging. Includes option to apply to add a co-host.
Co-host Model|![contest_live_cele.png](images/contest_live_cele.png)|Allows audience members to see the host and co-host (for example, a celebrity). The co-host can also interact with the host and answer questions.
Team Model|![contest_live_group.png](images/contest_live_group.png)|Allows the audience members to answer questions as a team.

### API Services

The game show template is a turnkey solution for live trivia game applications.

The template is broken down into three API services:

Service|Description
---|---
Media service|Handles audio/video streaming
Signaling service|Handles questions, answers, messaging, and comments
Customer service|Handles registration/login, notifications, and payments

![contest_task.png](images/contest_task.png)

The figure above, show the template solution breakdown, along with the features each service would handle. The green blocks indicate services the Agora SDK currently provides.

### Communication Breakdown

The main communication for the live application network consists of the host(s), services, and audience members. The image below depicts the general communication flow the game show template uses:

Location|Label|Description
---|---|---
Left grey box|`Room of the Host`|Represents the host(s) for the application
Middle grey box|`SD-RTN`|Represents the Agora SDK services
Right grey box|`User Group`|Represents the audience members

![contest_solution.png](images/contest_solution.png)

Service|Description
---|---
Live Broadcast Service|The host(s) push realtime audio and video streams to the audience members using the Agora Interactive Broadcast SDK
Signaling Service|Facilitates communication between the audience and the host using the The Agora Signaling SDK<ul><li>Retrieves the number of current users in the channel</li><li>Manages messaging between the host and the audience members</li><li>Pushes questions and answers synchronously, ensuring the video stream is synchronized with the questions</li></ul>
`Customer service`|Manages non-Agora SDK communication between the host and audience members
`RTMP Streaming`|Handles sharing to social media platforms

**Note:** Audience members who join and become co-hosts will begin using the communication protocols and services as a host, rather than an audience member.



## Hardware / Software Requirements

For mobile applications, use a physical device when publishing. Some simulators lack the functionality or the performance needed to run the Agora SDK functionality.

Platform|Software|OS / Device
---|---|---
**Windows**|Visual Studio 2013 or higher<br><br>OBS Studio (only required if running the game with OBS Studio enabled)|Windows 7 or higher
**Android**|Android Studio 3.0 or above|Android device (e.g. Nexus 5X)
**iOS**|Xcode 8.0+ (Ensure a valid provisioning profile is applied to your project, or it will not run)|Physical iOS device (iPhone or iPad)


## Customize the UI

There are two versions of the audience member application. One for Android, and the other for the iOS.

The audience member application consists of three main screens. The loading screen, the game screen, and the information screen. The screen layouts are customizable and use native UI components from Android Studio and Xcode.

Screen|Android View|iOS View|Functionality
---|---|---|---
Main screen|![androidMainScreen.jpg](images/androidMainScreen.jpg)|![iosMainScreen.jpg](images/iosMainScreen.jpg)|Displays when the next game will start<br><br>Allows the user to log into a game<br><br>Displays their prize winnings
Game screen|![androidGameScreen.jpg](images/androidGameScreen.jpg)|![iosGameScreen.jpg](images/iosGameScreen.jpg)|Where the user answers questions for the game
Information screen|![androidInfoScreen.jpg](images/androidInfoScreen.jpg)|![iosInfoScreen.jpg](images/iosInfoScreen.jpg)|Where the user can send the game to their friends or view contact information for the game owner


## How to Use the Template

### Download the HQ SDK and Choose a Template Branch

Download the HQ 2nd Stage SDK [here](https://apprtcio-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/zhangle_agora_io/EqI4y81PsbtIuxsPL_jZwL0Bl8H4TomX001-AthJVRbl3Q?e=5Z2CPb). The HQ 2nd Stage SDK is available for Android, iOS, and Windows.

Unzip the downloaded file and choose the most applicable template branch for project: 

Branch|Description
---|---
`master`|Empty branch. Do not use.
`Solution-With-AgoraHQSigKit`|(Deprecated) Based on HQ 1st stage SDK, with basic HQ functions
`Solution-for-TeamUpMode`|Based on HQ 2nd stage SDK. Includes "Team" mode and "Host-in" mode.
`Solution-for-TeamUpMode-Http`|Encompasses functionality of `Solution-for-TeamUpMode`. Adds use of http as a communication protocol between the server and clients.
`Solution-for-TeamUpMode-Http-obs-studio`|Encompasses functionality of `Solution-for-TeamUpMode-Http`. Adds OBS support.


### Create an Account and Obtain an App ID
In order to build and run the sample application you must obtain an App ID: 

1. Create a developer account at [agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/). Once you finish the signup process, you will be redirected to the Dashboard.
2. Navigate in the Dashboard tree on the left to **Projects** > **Project List**.
3. Copy the App ID that you obtained from the Dashboard into a text file. You will use this when you launch the app.
